# README Generator
  ## Description

  This application is designed to simplify the process of creating a README file by generating a markdown file, freeing up more time for developing production code. To achieve this, the JavaScript code leverages inquirer dependencies to prompt the user for information, then writes the input to a file and uses template literals to create the README.
